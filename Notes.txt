Main Priority
- Have a search bar
- Have a options selection by Number and also Alphabetical order
- Search pokemon by type


We can do the main search bar and do fetch to front end render the pokemon on the main page.




Lower Priority 
- Search pokemon by picture and pagination? 
- Display pokemon weaknesses


Early Result - Pokedex

End Result - Team builder, but needs to know how to store Pokemon team and find their weaknesses

We will have the landing page of the website do fetch calls for pokemon that you can search in the serach bar.
Below it will have the generation 1 button, which will then show pokemon from one generation / maybe we will need to paginate.
Or we can do something where when you click next page it loads from the front end so the page doesnt need to refresh? maybe

We add an option selection drop down of pokemon to the list , which then adds the value into the input and searches.

Lets put more generations in there, we could even do all since we have the list thingy, and then we can make the card look better and add front size backside 
/ maybe shiny view.Then we can start on doing backend for the More about this pokemon option.

So it transitions kind of weirdly, I want to change it so it awaits and maybe loads all at once? seems to be a bit better maybe.

Fontside / Backside of card
Front side can have ability 
Back side will be containing attack stats and ability

Originally the search was to look the pokemon up by name, but there was special characters that pokemon have like farfetch 083 with its apostrophe,
so instead I had to look pokemon up by number, but had problems with auto filling in the search bar because it would look up by name, and takes the name from the value
of the option.
So I had to change the value of the option selected to the pokemon number and then fill in the searc textbox with the HTML TEXT of the options and not the value
of the options so options were originally value = "bulbasaur" > bulbasaur </> turned to value = "1"> bulbasaur </> 


//UNSOLVED 

Could not solve issue to do search by number without changing the input value shown. I wanted to show whats inputted in the searchb box as name BUT have the value
as the number of the pokemon but we cant do that because HTML input does not have a closing tag which means there is no innerHTML / textContent. The thing in the input
box is the VALUE and not the innerHTML. So to search by the number of the pokemon, the number will also have to show on inside the text input box.

In conclusion we have to just leave it the way it is because it is more intuative for the user and it looks nicer, but we cant search up anything that has special characters
such as farfetch and hopefully no one will come across this error.


To DO LIST 

- Loading for pokemon cards 
// A loader , we can put is a div that is absolute so it is sitting over the pokemon card 
- Backside card with stats and ability


// We can make it so the opacity is 0 then goes to 1 instead of doing display: none > block or whatever

We have a fetch in a fetch, maybe think of a way to not do that? Using promises?
Try splitting the front and back rendering into two different fuctions, so theyre not attached to each other

-box shadow the cards would be cool

-We are probably going to have to have a error catch in our program and catch the error and render a pokemon card saying something like - Pokemon Information
in the database is incomplete. Please try again in teh future.

- lets work on the mobile responsiveness
- then work on fixing the pokemon backside not rendering
- remember to do a hovering effect on stuff
- it would be cool to have a fade function, where in mobile the card repeatedly flips back and fourth between the front and back side

Under the pokemon logo we can have a small font that says something like "Got to catch em all"

The sizes of the cards are too big for smaller resolution screens, we're gonna need to have a fix for that.
